This will create a configuration file called redirect_me.conf in the /etc/nginx/sites-available directory with a server block that listens on port 80, matches requests to /redirect_me and redirects them to https://example.com/ with a "301 Moved Permanently" status.



#Enable the configuration file

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/redirect_me.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/


#Test and reload the server

sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
